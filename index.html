Hi, My name is Zoe Wong-VanHaren. <br>
I'm a student at Palo Alto High School, in the graduating class of 2020. <br>
     In my free time, I wrestle for Paly's co-ed Wrestling Team and write for <a href= "https://verdemagazine.com">Verde Magazine</a> and take photos for the <a href="http://sundaylens.com">Sunday Lens</a>. <br>
   This website was inspired by <a href="https://johnafish.ca">John Fish's</a> and, like his, has notes, my portfolio, and links to my socials. I'm currently learning to code HTML on my own at home, using Khan Academy.
