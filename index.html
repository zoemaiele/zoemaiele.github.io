Hi, My name is Zoe Wong-VanHaren.
I'm a student at Palo Alto High School, in the graduating class of 2020. In my free time, I wrestle for Paly's co-ed Wrestling Team and write for <a href= "https://verdemagazine.com"> Verde Magazine </a> and take photos for the <a href="http://sundaylens.com"> Sunday Lens </a>. 
   This website was inspired by <a href="johnafish.ca"> John Fish's </a> and, like his, has notes, my portfolio, and links to my socials. I'm currently learning to code HTML on my own at home, using Khan Academy.
