Hi, My name is Zoe Wong-VanHaren.
I'm a student at Palo Alto High School, in the graduating class of 2020. In my free time, I wrestle for Paly's co-ed Wrestling Team and write for [Verde Magazine](http://verdemagazine.com) and take photos for the [Sunday Lens](http://sundaylens.com). 
This website was inspired by [John Fish's](johnafish.ca) and, like his, has notes, my portfolio, and links to my socials.
